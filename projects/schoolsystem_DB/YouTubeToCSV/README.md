# YouTubeToCSV

This script uses the YouTube Data API to fetch metadata for videos listed in `VideoURLs.txt` and writes them into CSV files. It expects an API key in `youtube_api_key.txt` located in the same directory.

1. Put your YouTube Data API key into `youtube_api_key.txt`.
2. Run `python YouTubeToCSV.py` and follow the prompts.

The key file is ignored by Git so you can keep your credentials private.
