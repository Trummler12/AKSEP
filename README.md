# AKSEP
A Repository dedicated to our upcoming political Party DIE AKSEP

## Development Server

Run the AKSEP preview server from the repository root:

```bash
npm run AKSEP
```

The command installs dependencies and starts Eleventy from the `projects/AKSEP` directory. The `src` folder merely holds the deployable files that Eleventy processes. You can view the site at `http://localhost:8080` (default). The generated files appear directly in `projects/AKSEP`.

### Ausblick

In future versions, additional scripts will allow starting previews for multiple projects at once, including a command `npm run all` to launch all preview servers.
